I'll break down each part of the TaskGraphBuilder implementation in detail:

First, let's look at the instance variables:

groovy:
TaskGraph graph = new TaskGraph()           // Holds the actual graph being built
private Map<String, Vertex> vertexCache = [:]       // Caches vertices by name for quick lookup
private Vertex currentVertex                        // Tracks which vertex we're currently configuring

The static build method creates the DSL entry point:

static TaskGraph build(Closure closure) {
    def builder = new TaskGraphBuilder()
    closure.delegate = builder                      // Makes the builder methods available inside the closure
    closure.resolveStrategy = Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST // Prioritizes builder methods over other methods
    closure()                                       // Executes the DSL closure
    return builder.graph                            // Returns the constructed graph
}

The vertex method is the core building block:

def vertex(String name, Class type, Closure closure = null) {
    // Create and register the vertex
    def vertex = new Vertex(name, type)
    vertexCache[name] = vertex                      // Store for later lookup by name
    graph.addVertex(vertex)                         // Add to the actual graph

    // Handle nested configuration
    if (closure) {
        def prevVertex = currentVertex              // Save previous vertex (for nested definitions)
        currentVertex = vertex                      // Set this as current vertex for inner config
        closure.delegate = this                     // Make builder methods available in inner closure
        closure.resolveStrategy = Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST
        closure()                                   // Execute the vertex configuration
        currentVertex = prevVertex                  // Restore previous vertex
    }

    return vertex
}

The conditions methods add validation rules to vertices:

def conditions(Map<String, Closure> conditions) {
    if (!currentVertex) {                          // Safety check - must be inside vertex block
        throw new IllegalStateException("conditions must be called within a vertex block")
    }
    currentVertex.conditionsMap.putAll(conditions)  // Add all conditions at once
}

def condition(String name, Closure condition) {
    if (!currentVertex) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("condition must be called within a vertex block")
    }
    currentVertex.conditionsMap[name] = condition   // Add single condition
}

The connectsTo methods establish relationships between vertices:

def connectsTo(String targetName, Map conditions = null) {
    if (!currentVertex) {                          // Safety check - must be inside vertex block
        throw new IllegalStateException("connectsTo must be called within a vertex block")
    }

    def targetVertex = vertexCache[targetName]      // Look up target vertex by name
    if (!targetVertex) {                           // Verify target exists
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Target vertex '${targetName}' not found")
    }

    // Add edge with or without conditions
    if (conditions) {
        graph.addEdgeWithCondition(currentVertex, targetVertex, conditions)
    } else {
        graph.addEdge(currentVertex, targetVertex)
    }
}

// Convenience method for connecting to multiple targets
def connectsTo(List<String> targetNames, Map conditions = null) {
    targetNames.each { targetName ->
        connectsTo(targetName, conditions)
    }
}

Here's how it all works together in practice:
def graph = buildTaskGraph {                       // Starts build process
    vertex("start", StartTask) {                   // Creates vertex named "start"
        condition("init", { true })                // Adds a condition to "start"
        connectsTo("process")                      // Connects "start" to "process"
    }

    vertex("process", ProcessTask) {               // Creates and configures "process" vertex
        conditions([                               // Adds multiple conditions
            "dataAvailable": { it.hasData() },
            "validFormat": { it.isValid() }
        ])
        connectsTo(["success", "error"])           // Connects to multiple targets
    }
}
The key features that make this DSL work well are:

The vertex cache allows referring to vertices by name
The currentVertex tracking enables nested configuration
The closure delegate system makes the DSL methods available in the right scope
The builder maintains the graph structure internally
Error checking ensures valid graph construction

This implementation allows for a natural, hierarchical way to define graph structures while maintaining proper relationships and conditions between vertices. CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.WWand provide function to the builder to generate a json formatted representation of the graph that can be stored and retrieved from a fileEditI'll add methods to serialize and deserialize the graph to/from JSON format.
TaskGraph DSL Builder with JSON SerializationClick to open code
Here's how you can use the JSON serialization features:

// Create a graph
def graph = buildTaskGraph {
    vertex("start", StartTask) {
        condition("init", { true })
        connectsTo("process")
    }

    vertex("process", ProcessTask) {
        conditions([
            "dataAvailable": { it.hasData() },
            "validFormat": { it.isValid() }
        ])
        connectsTo(["success", "error"])
    }

    vertex("success", SuccessTask)
    vertex("error", ErrorTask)
}

// Save to JSON file
graph.saveToFile("taskgraph.json")

// Later, load the graph from JSON
def loadedGraph = TaskGraphBuilder.loadFromFile("taskgraph.json")
The JSON output will look something like this:
jsonCopy{
    "vertices": [
        {
            "name": "start",
            "type": "com.example.StartTask",
            "conditions": {
                "init": "{ true }"
            },
            "connections": ["process"]
        },
        {
            "name": "process",
            "type": "com.example.ProcessTask",
            "conditions": {
                "dataAvailable": "{ it.hasData() }",
                "validFormat": "{ it.isValid() }"
            },
            "connections": ["success", "error"]
        },
        {
            "name": "success",
            "type": "com.example.SuccessTask",
            "conditions": {},
            "connections": []
        },
        {
            "name": "error",
            "type": "com.example.ErrorTask",
            "conditions": {},
            "connections": []
        }
    ]
}

Important notes about this implementation:

The JSON serialization captures:

Vertex names and types
Conditions (as string representations)
Connections between vertices


Limitations/Considerations:

Closure serialization is simplified - in a production environment, you'd want more robust closure serialization/deserialization
The type information is stored as class names, so the classes must be available in the classpath when deserializing
Complex condition logic might need special handling


Features:

Pretty-printed JSON for readability
File-based persistence
Two-pass deserialization to ensure all vertices exist before creating connections
Support for both single-file operations and string-based JSON operations



Would you like me to add any additional serialization features or modify the existing implementation?
