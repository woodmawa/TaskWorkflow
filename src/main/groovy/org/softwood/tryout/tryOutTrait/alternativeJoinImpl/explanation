Let me break down how this task coordination system works step by step.

First, the core components:

groovyCopyenum TaskStatus {
    NOT_STARTED,
    RUNNING,
    COMPLETED,
    FAILED
}
This enum tracks the state of each task in the workflow.
groovyCopyclass TaskVertex extends Vertex {
    TaskStatus status = TaskStatus.NOT_STARTED  // Current state
    def result                                 // Stores task output
    Set<String> requiredPredecessors = []      // For join nodes - tracks required inputs
}
TaskVertex extends the original Vertex class to add:

Status tracking
Result storage
List of required predecessors (especially important for join nodes)


The isReadyToExecute() method is key for coordination:

groovyCopyboolean isReadyToExecute() {
    // Special logic for join nodes
    if (type == JoinTask) {
        return requiredPredecessors.every { predecessorName ->
            def predecessor = graph.lookupVertexByTaskName(predecessorName)
            predecessor?.status == TaskStatus.COMPLETED
        }
    }
    // Regular nodes just need to be NOT_STARTED
    return status == TaskStatus.NOT_STARTED
}
This method:

For join nodes: checks if ALL required predecessor tasks are completed
For regular nodes: checks if the task hasn't started yet


The TaskGraphExecutor manages execution:

groovyCopyclass TaskGraphExecutor {
    private TaskGraph graph
    private Map<String, TaskVertex> vertexCache

    void execute() {
        // Start with the head node
        def currentVertex = graph.head
        processVertex(currentVertex)
    }
}

The core processing logic happens in processVertex:

groovyCopyprivate void processVertex(TaskVertex vertex) {
    // Only process if ready
    if (!vertex.isReadyToExecute()) {
        return
    }

    vertex.status = TaskStatus.RUNNING

    try {
        // Execute the task
        def result = executeTask(vertex)
        vertex.result = result
        vertex.status = TaskStatus.COMPLETED

        // Process successors
        def successors = graph.getToVertices(vertex)
        successors.each { successor ->
            // Update predecessor tracking for join nodes
            if (successor.type == JoinTask) {
                successor.requiredPredecessors << vertex.name
            }
            processVertex(successor)
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        vertex.status = TaskStatus.FAILED
        throw e
    }
}
This method:

Checks if the vertex is ready to execute
Updates status to RUNNING
Executes the task
Stores the result
Updates status to COMPLETED
Processes successor nodes
Handles any errors
The executeTask method handles different types of nodes:

groovyCopyprivate def executeTask(TaskVertex vertex) {
    switch(vertex.type) {
        case ForkTask:
            // Execute successors in parallel
            def successors = graph.getToVertices(vertex)
            return successors.collectParallel { successor ->
                processVertex(successor)
            }

        case JoinTask:
            // Combine results from predecessors
            def predecessors = graph.getFromVertices(vertex)
            return predecessors.collect { it.result }

        default:
            // Regular task execution
            return vertex.conditionsMap.every { name, condition ->
                condition.call(vertex)
            }
    }
}
Here's how it all works together in a typical fork/join scenario:
groovyCopydef graph = buildTaskGraph {
    vertex("start", StartTask) {
        connectsTo("forkNode")
    }

    fork("forkNode") {
        connectsTo(["processA", "processB"]) // Creates parallel branches
    }

    // Parallel tasks
    vertex("processA", ProcessTask)
    vertex("processB", ProcessTask)

    // Join waits for both A and B
    join("joinNode", ["processA", "processB"]) {
        connectsTo("end")
    }

    vertex("end", EndTask)
}
The execution flow would be:

Start task executes
Fork node triggers parallel execution of processA and processB
Join node waits until BOTH processA and processB are marked as COMPLETED
Only when both are done, join node executes and combines their results
End task executes

The key coordination happens through:

Status tracking of each task
The requiredPredecessors list in join nodes
The isReadyToExecute() check before processing any node
Parallel execution at fork points using Groovy's collectParallel

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular part of this system?
